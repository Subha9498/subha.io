## Introduction

Part of the experience of visiting an unfamiliar city lies in its varied and rich culture. It is this culture that encompasses tradition through objects and symbols. Souvenirs are objects you bring back from your travel that bear some essence of the place. It doesn't have to be a direct obvious correlation. It could be a deep-rooted personal connection from the object to the experience.

It was not unusual for sailors of old to bring back objects and artifacts from their travels, and that is probably where the concept originated. 

However, the primitive needs of a medieval seaman do not even compare to the multi-faceted requirements of a modern day human being. We romanticize the notion of souvenirs but at the same time underrate the experience of buying over the item being bought.

Online shopping has in fact made life so much easier, however, when it comes to shopping for souvenirs or local delicacies, the experience is almost as important as the actual object itself, and therefore an online abstraction of a fruity deal between a tourist far away from home and a local shop owner would cease to retain most of its value.

The challenge lies in bringing the many advantages of online shopping and combining them with an alternate reality of a vacation time shopping experience.

## Design Process

The process was largely iterative over multiple stages with user inputs all along the way. I believe in a highly usable and accessible human-centric user experience. Considering this entire project was completed in less than 72 hours, corners had to be cut sometimes, but what I followed was a lean subset of my usual design process.

## Secondary Research

Analyzed existing solutions and current scenario to come up with the following insights:

* The solution should be tailored to the user. Listings are already available.
* Should be one cohesive experience - everything from the finding of the place to actually procuring the items
* Should place emphasis on real-world interaction rather than abstract it away as travelers tend to like interacting with locals

These insights shaped the ideation and brainstorming and were crucial in coming up with solutions as well as validating them.

## Ideation and Brainstorming

![](/images/local_3.jpg)

Used multiple thinking tools and divergent thinking techniques to speed up and come up with a wide array of ideas -- everything from Augmented Reality to tangible solutions was explored. I tried not to restrict ideas at this stage and wanted to get quantity over quality while thinking wide.

Multiple similar ideas were clustered and converged to get a better idea. This was iterated until there was a manageable amount of good ideas.

## Validation Framework

A series of steps which included divergence and convergence into individual ideas reduced the number of ideas that could be implemented. Finally, the remaining ideas were plotted on a value-effort graph to identify the more feasible ones, considering the short timeframe.

## Scope of the Solution

The solution is largely a mobile app that recommends places of interest including, but not limited to shops, around the location that the user travels to. It provides information, reviews, and even items on sale at interesting shops.

There is a stories section that includes curated lists of shops in a small area every day, and an article that accompanies it. This helps feature content and can serve as an avenue for monetization. 

There is a map component that allows the user to find near and rare places of interest while they are traveling in an unfamiliar place.

Recommender System that smartly understands personalized needs and preferences. The algorithm reduces the chances of the same content being recommended multiple times, and rank would reduce significantly for a shop/attraction once the user has viewed it and bounced without any sort of engagement.

Listings with higher bounce rate, in general, would get flagged as low-quality content and would be less likely to be recommended.

The system tracks weather updates, and changes in real time and would ask the user when he/she is planning to go out so that it can recommend appropriate experiences keeping in mind the attributes like weather, time of the day, and season. Ideally, the system would not highly recommend an apple farm unless it's apple season.

## Business Strategy

There are multiple avenues for monetization models available -- The local shops that offer any services can be featured in "Nearby" for a certain fee. 

Options to offer discount coupons valid at selected local shops would increase traffic to that shop, thereby increasing business as well as reach.

Recommender Systems have been trained on models that conform to the users' needs as well as the business goals. This would mean that monetized sources like shops with offers or featured shops would get recommended more - resulting in a wider reach.

The first launch with a limited amount of listings  - dense but in a small area can accurately measure extrapolatable reach and engagement.

## Wireframes

Low fidelity pen and paper wireframes were drawn up to get intermediate user feedback. The feedback was crucial in identifying key usability issues in the wireframe level itself and were solved subsequently before moving to the visual design of the application.

## Visual Design

Consistency is key. The visual design is based on a highly consistent system that uses Fibonacci series for font-sizing, spacing, and even lay outing. This, combined with the soothing color scheme, creates a very aesthetic composition that makes using the app a delight.

## Accessibility - WCAG 2.0

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. Compliance with the Guidelines makes content accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity and combinations of these.

Accessibility was a major factor during the entire visual design phase, and most design decisions have been taken keeping accessibility in mind.

The Visual Design of this app including all aspects of the UI and color palette conform to at least AA on the WCAG 2.0 Specifications.
